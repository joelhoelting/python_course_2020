# ----------------------------------------
# "bitwise right shift" ('>>' Operator)
# Returns x with the bits shifted to the left by y places (and new bits on the right-hand-side are zeros). 
# This is the same as multiplying x by 2**y.

# "bitwise and" ('&' Operator)
# Does a "bitwise and". Each bit of the output is 1 if the corresponding bit of x AND of y is 1, otherwise it's 0.

# "bitwise INVERSION" ('~'operator)
#~ x
# Returns the complement of x - the number you get by switching each 1 for a 0 and each 0 for a 1. 
#This is the same as -x - 1.

# "bitwise EXCLUSIVE OR / XOR" ('^' operator)
#x ^ y Does a "bitwise exclusive or". 
# Each bit of the output is the same as the corresponding bit in x if that bit in y is 0, 
# and it's the complement of the bit in x if that bit in y is 1.
